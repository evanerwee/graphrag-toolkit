    This class is designed to wrap an existing VectorStore and provide a

    through this wrapper are not writeable. This class can be useful when you
    want to share or use a VectorStore in a context where modifications to it
    are not allowed.

        inner (VectorStore): The underlying VectorStore being wrapped. All read
            operations are delegated to this inner VectorStore.

        This method ensures that the vector store is encapsulated in a `ReadOnlyVectorStore`
