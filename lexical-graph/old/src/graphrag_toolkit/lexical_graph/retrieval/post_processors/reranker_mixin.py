    This class serves as a foundational mixin for implementing custom rerankers.
    It defines the required interface that any subclass must implement, including
    a property to retrieve batch size and a method to rerank given pairs of data.
    Subclasses of this mixin are expected to define domain-specific behavior for
    reranking operations.

    Attributes:
        batch_size (int): Abstract property defining the number of items processed
            in a batch by the reranker.

        This property serves as an interface for retrieving or working with the batch size,
        making it mandatory to implement in any subclass that inherits from the class which
        declares this property. Subclasses must define the behavior and value associated
        with this property.
