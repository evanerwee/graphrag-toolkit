    Handles the processing and transformation of node data.

    This class is designed to process a collection of nodes with optional
    parameters. It serves as a base class for customizable node handling
    operations, requiring the implementation of the `accept` method to
    define specific processing logic. The `__call__` method is provided
    for use as a callable, enabling straightforward invocation of the
    processing logic.

        Processes and filters a list of nodes by applying the accept method to each node.

        The method takes a list of BaseNode objects, applies the accept method, and
