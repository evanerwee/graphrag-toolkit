    This class allows for storing and retrieving scoped values using a graph database.
    Scoped values are organized by a label and associated with a defined scope for easy
    management and retrieval.

        Fetches distinct values associated with a specific label and scope from the graph database.

        This function performs a Cypher query to retrieve distinct values from nodes that match
        the specified label and scope in the graph database. The results are then extracted and
        returned as a list.

        Args:
            label (str): The label used to identify the nodes in the graph.
            scope (str): The scope value to filter nodes in the graph.

        Returns:
            List[str]: A list of distinct values associated with the input label and scope from
            the graph database.

        Raises:
            Any exceptions raised by the `execute_query` method within `self.graph_store` or
            any database-related issues will propagate to the caller.

        Saves a list of values associated with a specific label and scope to the graph store. Each value is
        processed within the provided scope, and the method ensures a unique combination of scope and value

            label (str): The label used to dynamically define the node label in the query. This allows for
                compartmentalization of values within the graph store.
            scope (str): A string defining the specific scope in which values will be stored. Used as an
                attribute to uniquely identify nodes and group values accordingly.
