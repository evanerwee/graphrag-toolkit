    Parses source documents and provides an interface for handling document parsing logic.

    This class serves as an abstract base for implementing source document parsing
    functionality. The main purpose of the class is to define a generic interface that
    subclasses implement to customize how source documents are parsed. It ensures a
    consistent API for parsing while delegating the specific implementation of parsing
    to the subclasses.

        Parses a collection of source documents and processes them into a specified format.

        This method is intended to be overridden by subclasses to provide specific
        logic for processing the input documents and transforming them into the desired
        output. The input documents should be iterable, and the output must also be an
        iterable containing the processed documents. This is an abstract method, and
        instantiating the containing class without implementing this method will result
        in errors.

        Args:
            source_documents: An iterable of `SourceDocument` instances representing
                the input documents to be processed.

        Returns:
            An iterable of `SourceDocument` instances representing the processed
            version of the source documents.

        Raises:
            NotImplementedError: If the method is not implemented by the subclass.
