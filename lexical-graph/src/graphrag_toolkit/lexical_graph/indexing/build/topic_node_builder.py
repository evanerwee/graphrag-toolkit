    Builds Topic-related nodes by processing existing nodes and their metadata.

    This class inherits from NodeBuilder and provides functionality to create

    aggregating associated statements, and managing relationships between source
    and topic nodes. It ensures clean and structured data for topic-based
    processing and indexing.

    Attributes:
        name (str): Class-level method that returns the name of the builder as
            'TopicNodeBuilder'.
        metadata_keys (List[str]): Class-level method that returns a list of metadata
            keys specific to this builder. Contains the key for identifying topics
            in metadata.
