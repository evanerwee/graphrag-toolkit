    Processor that simplifies search results by condensing single-topic results.

    This processor is designed to analyze search results and simplify cases
    where a search result contains only one topic. It modifies the search
    result structure by transferring the topic and its statements to the
    main result attributes and clearing the list of topics. This can be
    useful in scenarios where topics are nested in search results and there
    is a need to normalize them for easier processing.

    Attributes:
        args (ProcessorArgs): Configuration and arguments that dictate
            the behavior of the processor.
        filter_config (FilterConfig): Configuration that defines filtering
            settings for the processor.

            args: The processor arguments providing configuration details required for setting

         the complexity in individual search result elements by simplifying topics when applicable.
