    Handles the clearing of chunks within topics in a collection of search results.

    The ClearChunks class is responsible for modifying topics by removing their
    associated chunks. This is done iteratively over a collection of search results.
    It inherits from `ProcessorBase` and utilizes its utility methods to perform
    operations on topics and search results. This processor may be used in
    situations where textual or data chunks associated with topics need to be
    removed from search results for further processing or analysis.

    Attributes:
        args (ProcessorArgs): Configuration arguments passed to the processor,
            defining its behavior and settings.
        filter_config (FilterConfig): Filtering configuration that determines
            how the processor handles filtering-related tasks.

        Args:

        Processes search results by clearing the chunks in associated topics.

        This method processes a collection of search results, applying an operation to
        clear all chunks associated with the topics in each search result. It modifies
        the input search results collection and returns the processed results.
