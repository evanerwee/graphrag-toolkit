    """A retriever class implementing topic-based search within a knowledge
    graph.

    The TopicBasedSearch class specializes in retrieving information from a graph database
    using a topic-based approach. It extends the TraversalBasedBaseRetriever to provide
    functionality specific to exploring the graph based on topic relationships. The retriever
    employs both a graph store for hierarchical relationships and a vector store for semantic queries.

    This is particularly useful in scenarios where topic-centric information
    organization and retrieval are required.

    Attributes:
        graph_store (GraphStore): An instance of the backing graph database used to
            execute cypher queries.
        vector_store (VectorStore): A vector store used for semantic representation
            and querying.
        processor_args (Optional[ProcessorArgs]): Optional arguments for
            configuring preprocessing workflows.
        processors (Optional[List[Type[ProcessorBase]]]): A list of processor
            classes for custom data preprocessing.
        filter_config (FilterConfig): Configuration for how filtering should be
            applied to retrieve results.
