    """
    Provides functionality for constructing edges from DataFrame relationships.

    This class is responsible for generating a list of nodes and edges based on the
    relationships defined within a given pandas DataFrame. It extends functionality from
    a ConstructorProvider class, allowing it to process data for graph-based representations
    or analysis.

    Methods
    -------
    construct(data)
        Constructs edges and nodes from the provided DataFrame.

    def construct(self, data: pd.DataFrame) -> Tuple[List[Node], List[Edge]]:
        """
        Converts a given DataFrame into nodes and edges.

        This method processes the input DataFrame and triage_constructs a list of nodes
        and edges based on its data. The structure of the DataFrame is expected to
        conform to the necessary format suitable for the transformation.

        Parameters:
        data: pd.DataFrame
            The input DataFrame containing the data to be converted
            into nodes and edges. The DataFrame must contain the
            required information for defining both the nodes and their connections.

        Returns:
        Tuple[List[Node], List[Edge]]
            A tuple where the first element is a list of nodes and the second
            element is a list of edges derived from the input DataFrame.
