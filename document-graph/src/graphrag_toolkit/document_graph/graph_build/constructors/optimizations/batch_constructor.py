        Construct nodes and edges from a given DataFrame.

        This method processes the given DataFrame and triage_constructs a list of nodes and edges
        based on its content. The method is designed to be extended with additional processing
        to handle large DataFrames in batches.

        Raises:
            ValueError: If the DataFrame is invalid or does not meet the required format.

        Args:
            data (pd.DataFrame): Input DataFrame containing information to construct nodes
            and edges.

        Returns:
            Tuple[List[Node], List[Edge]]: A tuple containing a list of constructed nodes
            and edges.
