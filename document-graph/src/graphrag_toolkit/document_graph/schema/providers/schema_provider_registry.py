"""Schema Provider Registry Module for Document Graph Operations.

This module provides a registry system for schema providers, allowing for runtime
registration and lookup of provider classes by name. It centralizes the management
of available schema provider types and ensures that providers can be dynamically
added and retrieved.

The module includes the following components:
- SchemaProviderRegistry: Registry class for managing schema provider classes

The SchemaProviderRegistry maintains a dictionary of provider names to provider classes
and provides methods for registering new providers, retrieving providers by name, and
listing all available providers. This registry is used by the schema provider factory
to look up provider classes based on configuration.

Usage:
    # Create a registry and register providers
    from graphrag_toolkit.document_graph.schema.providers.schema_provider_registry import SchemaProviderRegistry
    from graphrag_toolkit.document_graph.schema.providers.file_schema_provider import FileSchemaProvider
    from graphrag_toolkit.document_graph.schema.providers.s3_schema_provider import S3SchemaProvider
    
    registry = SchemaProviderRegistry()
    registry.register("file", FileSchemaProvider)
    registry.register("s3", S3SchemaProvider)
    
    # Look up a provider by name
    provider_class = registry.get("file")
    
    # List all registered providers
    available_providers = registry.list()
