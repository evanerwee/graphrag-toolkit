"""Normalize Whitespace Provider module for document graph operations.

This module provides a transformer provider implementation for normalizing whitespace
in text fields of document records. It supports:

- Removing leading and trailing whitespace
- Replacing multiple consecutive whitespace characters with a single space
- Processing of multiple configurable fields
- Preservation of non-string and empty values

Whitespace normalization is useful for improving text consistency, enhancing
search and matching operations, and preparing text for further processing or
display.
