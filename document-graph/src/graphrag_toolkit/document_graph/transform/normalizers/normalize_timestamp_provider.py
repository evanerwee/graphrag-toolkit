"""Normalize Timestamp Provider module for document graph operations.

This module provides a transformer provider implementation for normalizing timestamp
strings in document records to a standard ISO 8601 format. It supports:

- Parsing various datetime string formats using dateutil.parser
- Converting parsed datetimes to ISO 8601 format
- Processing of multiple configurable fields
- Graceful handling of errors during timestamp parsing
- Preservation of non-string and empty values

Timestamp normalization is useful for standardizing date and time representations,
enabling consistent sorting and comparison operations, and ensuring compatibility
with various systems and databases.
