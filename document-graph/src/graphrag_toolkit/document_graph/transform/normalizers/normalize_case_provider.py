"""Normalize Case Provider module for document graph operations.

This module provides a transformer provider implementation for normalizing the case
of text strings in document records. It supports:

- Converting text to lowercase (default)
- Converting text to uppercase
- Other case transformations supported by Python string methods

The provider applies case normalization to all string fields in each record,
preserving non-string fields unchanged. This is useful for standardizing text data
across records, improving search and matching operations, and preparing text for
further processing.
