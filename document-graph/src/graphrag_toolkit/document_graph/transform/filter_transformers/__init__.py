"""Filter transformers module for document graph operations.

This package provides transformer implementations that filter or modify data
during document graph processing. It includes transformers for:

- Column pruning: Removes specified columns (fields) from records
- Row filtering: Filters records based on field conditions with various operators
  such as equality, inequality, comparison, and null checks

These transformers help in data preparation and cleaning by allowing selective
processing of records and fields based on configurable criteria.
