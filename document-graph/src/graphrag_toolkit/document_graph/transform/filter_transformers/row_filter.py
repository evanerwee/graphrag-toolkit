"""Row Filter module for document graph operations.

This module provides the RowFilterProvider transformer, which filters records based on
field conditions during document graph processing. It supports various comparison
operators such as equality, inequality, comparison, and null checks.

This transformer is useful for data preparation and cleaning by allowing selective
processing of records based on configurable criteria.

    This transformer allows for selective record processing by filtering records
    based on field conditions. It supports various comparison operators such as
    equality, inequality, comparison, and null checks. Records are kept only if
    they satisfy all the specified conditions.
    
    Args:
        The provider expects the following arguments in the `args` dictionary:
            conditions (List[Dict[str, Any]]): A list of condition dictionaries.
                Each condition dictionary must have the following keys:
                - field (str): The name of the field to check.
                - operator (str): The comparison operator to use. Supported operators are:
                    - "eq": Equal to
                    - "ne": Not equal to
                    - "lt": Less than
                    - "gt": Greater than
                    - "null": Field is null
                    - "not_null": Field is not null
                - value (Any): The value to compare against. Required for "eq", "ne",
                  "lt", and "gt" operators. Not used for "null" and "not_null" operators.
    
    Raises:
        ValueError: If an unsupported operator is specified.
