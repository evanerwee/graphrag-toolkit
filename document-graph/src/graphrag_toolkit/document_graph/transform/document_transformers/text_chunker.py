"""Text Chunker module for splitting document content into manageable chunks.

This module provides functionality to divide long text content into smaller,
overlapping chunks for more efficient processing and analysis. This is particularly
useful for large documents that need to be processed in smaller segments, such as
for embedding generation, semantic search, or other NLP operations that have
input size limitations.

    This transformer divides text content from records into smaller chunks
    of a specified size, with optional overlap between consecutive chunks.
    Each chunk becomes a separate record that maintains the original record's
    metadata while adding chunk-specific information.
    
    Configuration:
        chunk_size (int): Maximum size of each text chunk in characters.
                         Defaults to 512.
        overlap (int): Number of characters to overlap between consecutive chunks.
                      Defaults to 0 (no overlap).
        text_field (str): The field name containing the text to chunk.
                         Defaults to 'content'.

        This method processes each record by:
        1. Extracting the text from the specified field
        2. Dividing it into chunks of the configured size
        3. Creating new records for each chunk with additional metadata
        
        Records without text content or with non-string content in the specified
        field are passed through unchanged.
        
        Each chunk record includes the following additional fields:
        - chunk_index: Sequential index of the chunk (0-based)
        - chunk_start: Character position where the chunk starts in the original text
        - chunk_end: Character position where the chunk ends in the original text
        - original_id: The ID of the original record
        
        If the original record has an 'id' field, each chunk's ID will be
        formatted as "{original_id}-chunk-{chunk_index}".
