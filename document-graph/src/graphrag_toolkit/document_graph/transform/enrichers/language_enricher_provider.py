"""Language Enricher Provider for detecting document languages.

This module provides functionality to automatically detect the language of text
content in documents. It uses the 'langdetect' library to identify the language
of text fields and adds this information as a new field in the document record.
This enrichment is useful for multilingual document collections, enabling filtering,
routing, or specialized processing based on document language.
