"""LLM Enricher Plugin for enhancing documents with AI-generated content.

This module provides functionality to enrich document content using Large Language
Models (LLMs) via the OpenAI API. It can perform various tasks such as tagging,
summarization, and classification of document content, adding the AI-generated
outputs as new fields in the document records.

This enrichment is useful for adding semantic metadata to documents, generating
concise summaries, or categorizing content without manual intervention.
