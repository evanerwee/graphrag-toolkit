"""Regex-based text cleaning transformer for document graph operations.

This module provides a transformer that applies regular expression patterns to clean
and standardize text fields in records. It can be used to remove unwanted characters,
normalize formats, extract specific patterns, or perform other text cleaning operations
using the power and flexibility of regular expressions.

    This transformer applies a list of regular expression patterns to specified fields

    for standardizing text formats, removing unwanted characters or patterns, and
    performing other text cleaning operations.
