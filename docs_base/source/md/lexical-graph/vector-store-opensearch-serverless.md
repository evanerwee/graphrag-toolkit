### Overview

You can use an Amazon OpenSearch Serverless collection as a vector store.

### Install dependencies

The OpenSeacrh vector store requires both the `opensearch-py` and `llama-index-vector-stores-opensearch` packages:

```
pip install opensearch-py llama-index-vector-stores-opensearch
```

### Creating an OpenSearch Serverless vector store

Use the `VectorStoreFactory.for_vector_store()` static factory method to create an instance of an Amazon OpenSearch Serverless vector store.

To create an Amazon OpenSearch Serverless vector store, supply a connection string that begins `aoss://`, followed by the https endpoint of the OpenSearch Serverless collection:

```python
from graphrag_toolkit.lexical_graph.storage import VectorStoreFactory

opensearch_connection_info = 'aoss://https://123456789012.us-east-1.aoss.amazonaws.com'

vector_store = VectorStoreFactory.for_vector_store(opensearch_connection_info)
```
